Instead, please send an email to: **security@yourproject.com**

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected versions, operating systems, configurations
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the vulnerability

### 🕐 Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of the report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with either a fix timeline or reason for non-acceptance
- **30 days**: Security patch release (for confirmed vulnerabilities)

### 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help us keep our users safe. With your permission, we will:

- Credit you in our security advisories
- List you in our security hall of fame
- Provide a public thank you (if desired)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Application Security

**API Security**
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (when applicable)
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- Authentication and authorization checks

**Data Protection**
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Secure handling of user input
- Data encryption in transit (HTTPS)
- Minimal data collection and retention

**Infrastructure Security**
- Redis configuration security
- Docker security best practices
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security updates

### Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities:

- **Automated scanning**: GitHub Dependabot alerts
- **Regular updates**: Monthly dependency reviews
- **Security patches**: Immediate response to critical vulnerabilities
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only necessary packages included

### Development Security

**Code Security**
- Security linting with ESLint security rules
- Code review requirements for all changes
- No sensitive data in repository
- Secure coding practices enforced

**CI/CD Security**
- Secrets management in CI/CD pipelines
- Security scanning in build process
- Signed commits encouraged
- Protected branches with required reviews

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### API Keys
- All external API keys are stored in environment variables
- No default or example keys are functional
- API key rotation procedures documented

### WebSocket Security
- Input validation on all WebSocket messages
- Rate limiting on WebSocket connections
- Secure origin validation

### Redis Security
- Redis AUTH configuration recommended
- Network security (firewall rules)
- No sensitive data stored in Redis cache

### File System Access
- No arbitrary file system access
- Logging paths properly secured
- Temporary file cleanup

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope for security reports:

- **Missing security headers** on non-sensitive endpoints
- **Rate limiting bypasses** that don't lead to significant impact
- **Social engineering attacks**
- **Physical attacks**
- **Denial of service** attacks requiring excessive resources
- **Issues in third-party dependencies** (report to the respective maintainers)
- **Vulnerabilities in development/test environments**

## 📚 Security Resources

### For Developers
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [Node.js Security Best Practices](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/security/)
- [React Security Best Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/ReactJS_Cheat_Sheet.html)

### For Users
- Keep your Node.js and npm versions updated
- Use strong, unique API keys
- Regularly rotate API credentials
- Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
- Use HTTPS in production deployments

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Headers
```javascript
// Express.js security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

### Environment Variables Security
```bash
# Use strong, unique values
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_strong_redis_password
API_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_random_secret

# Never commit these to version control
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```
