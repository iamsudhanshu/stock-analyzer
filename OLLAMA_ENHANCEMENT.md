## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### **OllamaService** (`backend/src/utils/ollama.js`)
Central service class managing all LLM interactions:

- **Model Management**: Automatic model detection and downloading
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for different analysis types
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and retry mechanisms
- **Response Parsing**: Robust JSON parsing with fallback values
- **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling and timeout management

#### **Agent Integration**
Each agent seamlessly integrates AI capabilities while maintaining traditional fallbacks:

- **Conditional Enhancement**: AI features activate only when Ollama is available
- **Graceful Degradation**: Full functionality without Ollama
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed logging of AI operations
- **Cache Integration**: AI results cached for efficiency

OLLAMA_ECONOMIC_MODEL=llama3.1:8b

# Performance Tuning
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=60000
OLLAMA_MAX_RETRIES=1
```

#### **Model Selection Strategy**
```javascript
// Optimized model selection based on task requirements
const modelConfig = {
  sentiment: 'llama3.1:8b',    // Balanced performance for text analysis
  technical: 'mistral:7b',     // Fast inference for pattern recognition
  economic: 'llama3.1:8b',     // Comprehensive reasoning for complex analysis
  general: 'phi3:medium'       // Lightweight for general tasks
