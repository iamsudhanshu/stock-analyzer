## üîß Technical Implementation

### LLM Integration Architecture
```javascript
class BaseAgent {
  constructor() {
    this.ollama = new OllamaService();
    this.ollamaEnabled = false;
    this.initializeLLM();
  }

  async initializeLLM() {
    this.ollamaEnabled = await this.ollama.isAvailable();
    if (this.ollamaEnabled) {
      console.log('‚úÖ LLM capabilities enabled');
    } else {
      console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è LLM not available, using enhanced traditional methods');
    }
  }
}
```

### LLM Processing Flow
1. **Data Collection**: Agent collects raw data from APIs
2. **LLM Analysis**: If LLM is available, data is sent to Ollama for analysis
3. **Response Parsing**: LLM response is parsed and structured
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: If LLM fails, enhanced traditional analysis is used
5. **Result Integration**: LLM insights are integrated with raw data

### Fallback Mechanisms
```javascript
async generateLLMInsights(data) {
  try {
    const response = await this.ollama.generate(prompt, options);
    return this.parseLLMResponse(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('LLM analysis failed, using fallback');
    return this.generateEnhancedTraditionalAnalysis(data);
  }
}
```
