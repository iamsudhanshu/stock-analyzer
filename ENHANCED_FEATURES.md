  newsSentiment: 'news_sentiment_queue',
  fundamental: 'fundamental_data_queue',
  competitive: 'competitive_analysis_queue',
  
  // New enhanced queues
  enhanced: 'enhanced_data_queue',

  report: 'report_generation_queue',
  analysis: 'analysis_queue',
  ui: 'ui_queue'
}
```

### Analysis Weights

Enhanced analysis weights for comprehensive scoring:

```javascript
analysisWeights: {
  technical: 0.25,
  sentiment: 0.20,
  fundamental: 0.25,
  competitive: 0.15,
  enhanced: 0.10,        // New
  advancedTechnical: 0.05 // New
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Running Enhanced Analysis

```bash
# Start the full enhanced system
npm run start

# Test individual agents
node test-enhanced-agents.js

# Start with specific mode
START_MODE=agents-only npm run start
```

### API Integration

The enhanced agents integrate seamlessly with the existing API:

// Enhanced analysis request
const analysis = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ symbol: 'AAPL' })
});

// Response now includes enhanced data
const result = await analysis.json();
console.log('Enhanced data:', result.rawData.enhancedData);
console.log('Advanced technical:', result.rawData.advancedTechnicalData);
console.log('Professional report:', result.rawData.reportData);
```

## Technical Architecture
