# Contributing to Stock Analysis Application

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Stock Analysis Application as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Set up the development environment** (see below)
4. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
5. **Make your changes** with tests
6. **Submit a pull request**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v8.0.0 or higher)
- Redis (v6.0 or higher)
- Git

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock-analysis-app.git
cd stock-analysis-app

# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Set up environment variables
cp backend/config.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your API keys (optional for development)

# Start Redis (using Docker)
docker run -d --name redis-dev -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:3001

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **JavaScript**: Follow ES6+ standards
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **CSS**: Follow BEM methodology where applicable
- **Formatting**: We use Prettier for code formatting
- **Linting**: ESLint for code quality

### Commit Messages
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(agents): add new economic indicator for inflation data
fix(ui): resolve WebSocket connection timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(analysis): add unit tests for sentiment scoring
```

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run backend tests only
npm run test:backend

# Run frontend tests only
npm run test:frontend

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test agent interactions and API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows

**Test Files:**
- Backend: `backend/src/**/*.test.js`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/**/*.test.js`

### Test Requirements
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Tests should be fast and reliable

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Multi-Agent System
When working with agents:
- Extend the `BaseAgent` class for new agents
- Use Redis pub/sub for inter-agent communication
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add graceful degradation for API failures

### API Integration
- Always implement rate limiting
- Provide fallback/mock data
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Cache responses appropriately

### Frontend Development
- Use React hooks for state management
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle errors gracefully
- Ensure responsive design

## üìù Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Update documentation** if needed
2. **Add or update tests** for your changes
3. **Run the test suite** and ensure all tests pass
4. **Check code formatting** with Prettier
5. **Verify the application works** end-to-end
